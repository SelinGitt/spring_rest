# spring_rest
The project is a simple library management system developed using the Spring Boot framework. 
It provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on books. The application uses a MySQL database to store book information, including title, author, and description.

The main components of the project include:

Book entity: Represents a book with properties such as title, author, and description.
BookRepository: Provides CRUD operations for managing book data in the database using Spring Data JPA.
BookController: Handles incoming HTTP requests, interacts with the BookRepository, and returns appropriate responses.
The project demonstrates how to build a basic RESTful API using Spring Boot, along with database integration using Spring Data JPA. 
It also showcases how to handle HTTP requests, perform CRUD operations on the database, and return responses in JSON format.
